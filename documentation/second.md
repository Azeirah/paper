I've thought about something else. The initial idea was a wallpaper manager around the idea of "channels". But thinking of it, after watching [Everything is Miscellaneous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHeta_YZ0oE). This whole idea of channels seems convoluted. Let's assume a wallpaper with a green grassfield, nice clear blue sky, a flock of birds and a little kid playing with a kite. What channel should this wallpaper be in? Nature? Sure. Trees? Sure. Green? Yep. Clear sky? Of course. Birds? Why not. Calm? Duh.

What would be really bad for my storage, and what would make things endlessly more complicated if I hadn't encountered this video. Each wallpaper is just a standalone wallpaper, that will be community-tagged. When a wallpaper gets uploaded, it needs to be tagged with *at least* one tag. Which will substitute our old idea of a "channel".

Good thing is, the term "tag" can replace the term "channel". So instead of "tagging" you "add" a wallpaper into a channel! How brilliant is that.

Say no to the evil king of complexity, all hail this enlightening simplifying unification!
