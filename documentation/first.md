We have:

What we want to do with channels:
- Find a channel
- Open them and view wallpapers that this channel will provide
- Subscribe to

What we want to do with our own (subscribed to) channels:
- The queue should pick wallpapers from our channels

Queue:
We need a data structure which holds references to all our subscribed channels locally

it will:
- Display a new wallpaper every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Be editable
- Set wallpaper right now
- Append wallpaper to queue
- Remove wallpaper from queue

We need a generic channel browser, to browse server-side channels. We then add these channels to our own channel-stuff

Our own channels, the channels we're subscribed to.
Other people's channels.
